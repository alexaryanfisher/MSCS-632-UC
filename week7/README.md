#  Week 7 - Concurrency: Data Processing System

## Deliverables:
### Data Sharing System
- Go Program : dataprocessing.go
- Results text file : results_go.txt
- Java Program : dataprocessing.java
- Results text file : results_java.txt

## Objectives:
- Develop and implement a Data Processing System which simulates multiple worker threads processing data in parallel. Data is retrieved from a shared task queue, prcossed, and results saved in a shared output resource.

  #### Key Features
  * Worker Threads
  * Concurrency Mangement
  * Error / Exception Handling
  * Logging
