# Week 2 - Analyzing Syntax and Semantics

## Deliverables:
### Scope and Closures
- Python Program - scopeclosurePython.py
- Javascript Program - scopeclosureJavascript.js
- C++ Program - scopeclosureC++.c++

### Memory Management
- Rust Program - Ownership.rs
- Java Program - GarbageCollection.java
- C++ Program - MemoryManagement.c++

## Objectives:
Scope and Closures: Write small programs in Python, Javascript, and C++ to visualize how each handles Scopes and Closures.
Memory Management: Write small programs in Rust, Java, and C++ that allocate and free memory dynamically. Highlighting differences beween memory management approachs.
